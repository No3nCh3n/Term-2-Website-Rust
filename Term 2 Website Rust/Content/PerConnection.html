<p>
Rust is always one of my favorite games of all time. When I first started this game, I wondered and got killed again and again. After a while, I was getting a better understanding of this game. However, I found out how ruthless and cruel this game is. People deceive each other to either loot the resources from them or for fun. Moreover, in this game, players build up bases to hide their loots, but people can raid your base to get loots from you. It is always dissatisfying when you log on and find out that the base that you built was raided. You'd have to be smart enough to be powerful in this game.
